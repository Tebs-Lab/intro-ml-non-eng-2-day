Porcha Woodruff was arrested for robbery and carjacking on Feb. 16th, 2023 following a facial recognition match. Woodruff was 8-months pregnant at the time. She was detained for 11 hours then released on a $100,000 personal bond. Her case has since been dismissed and she is now suing the Detroit Police Department (DPD) for damages caused by the false arrest.

This whole ordeal was based on a facial recognition match between gas station surveillance footage and a grainy mugshot of Woodruff from 2015 (Woodruff was arrested in 2015 for driving with an expired license).

# Additional Questions

* Consider the quality of both the training data (e.g. drivers license photos and surveillance camera footage).
    * What role does photo quality play in these results?
* Consider the users of this AI system.
    * What level of responsibility do police take?
    * To what extent could better training alleviate future issues (or not)?
